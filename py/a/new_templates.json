Please read the enclosed information for more details.\n\nIf you have a work related or business case reason to use Bit Torrent, please let us know, explaining your reasons, so that we can consider whitelisting your device.\nIf we do not hear from you and we continue to notice Bit Torrent activity on your account then further steps may be taken, including disabling your account, so that the King's College London reputation and network are not brought into disrepute.\n\nHere is some information you should know about illegal streaming services:\n\nIT Services Cyber Security have recently noticed a large increase in the volume of complaints from copyright holders and agents. The majority of complaints relate to files being shared which are films and television programmes.  This may be due to copyright holders and agents becoming more efficient at locating this illegal activity or that there has been a large increase in people abusing the King's College London network. \nDid you know Streaming pirated films, TV programmes and sport is a crime\n1 in 4 people who stream illegally* have been affected by viruses and malware\n1 in 10 people who stream illegally* have been a victim of fraud 1 in 20 people who stream illegally* have had their personal details stolen\n*those who stream through a modified box, stick or add-on and app.\nBy downloading with some software, you can also be sharing files.  A prime example is software using Bit Torrent technology, which shares (or uploads) parts of files whilst you are still downloading them.  You do not have to share the whole file to be in breach of copyright. \nOften file-sharing applications set themselves up to run in the background when a user turns their computer on.  If you have used such applications in the past on your own computer, make sure that they are removed or disabled before you bring your computer onto the King's College London network.  \nWith modern streaming services, there are numerous cost-effective ways of accessing a very wide range of content within the law and within King's College London's IT Acceptable Use policy. \nKing's College London does not condone the use of illegal streaming services or the illegal sharing of files within or outside of the university network.\n\nKind regards,\n\nIT Services Cyber Security\";"
