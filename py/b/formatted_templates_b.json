Stream is very limited, staff/students who did not attend will be left out of the viewing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOur current practice and what we suggest, is to remove all the attendees access or hide video in Stream (apart from admins), download the MP4, upload it to Kaltura, edit (top & tail, order captions etc) then share media link (https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=4646894&chapterid=421434) in Teams meeting chat, through KEATS course or even through email list once ready.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you have any further queries about your Kaltura recording please contact your Faculty's TEL officer - https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/learningteaching/ctel/Contact-Us/school-support-contacts.aspx\n\nKind Regards,\nIT Service Desk"

The intermittent Wi-Fi\network issues you may be experiencing is due to work taking place to update the King?s wired network across all our campuses and buildings. You can find out more on our Intranet page here:\n\nhttps://internal.kcl.ac.uk\news\news-article?id=8576ce1b-5b69-4339-ab9e-8c7a9449bb0b\n\nWe have some alternative solutions to help you connect to the Internet:\n\n1. If you are using a wired connection, please try to connect to Eduroam. Other floors should not be affected by the current works, so, if you are close to an access point on an adjacent floor, it may be possible to connect. \n\n2. If it is convenient to work on another floor, please try this, as connections should be working in these areas.\n\n3. If you are using a personal device and have a mobile phone, you may wish to use tethering. This allows you to use the internet from your mobile phone on your computer. \n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT PERSONAL DATA CHARGES MAY APPLY. KCL ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA CHARGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED. \n\nInstructions on how to tether to your phone are available below.

Using the device you want to connect with, scan for the Wi-Fi hotspot network, and enter the password when prompted. The password is automatically generated, but you can change it with a tap.

Sharing a connection this way is called tethering or using a hotspot. Some phones can share Wi-Fi connection by tethering. \n\nImportant: Some mobile operators limit or charge extra for tethering. We recommend checking with your operator. \n\nImportant: While it is easy to set up tethering, there is an added wrinkle for Android ? the user interface is not the same for every device. That means we can?t provide exact steps for every device. \n\nSome of these steps work only on Android 9 and up. \n\nTurn on your hotspot 1. Swipe down from the top of the screen. \n2. Tap Hotspot . \n? If you don?t find Hotspot , at the bottom left, tap Edit and drag Hotspot into your Quick Settings. \n\n---------------------------- OR -------------------------------------------------- \n\n? Go to Settings > Connections. \n\n? Tap Mobile Hotspot and Tethering. \n\n? Tap Mobile Hotspot. \n\n? Note the network name and password. \n\n? Toggle Mobile Hotspot On.\n\nChoose how to tether Tether by Wi-Fi \n\n1. Swipe down from the top of the screen. \n\n2. Touch and hold Hotspot . \n\n3. Turn on Wi-Fi hotspot. Tip: To find or change your hotspot name or password, tap it. You may need to first tap Set up Wi-Fi hotspot. \n\nConnect another device to your phone's hotspot \n\n1. On the other device, open that device's list of Wi-Fi options. \n\n2. Pick your phone's hotspot name. \n\n3. Enter your phone's hotspot password. \n\n4. Click Connect. \n\nIf you don't want your hotspot to require a password: \n\n1. Swipe down from the top of the screen. \n\n2. Touch and hold Hotspot . \n\n3. Under 'Security', tap None. Tip: You can share your phone's mobile data with up to 10 other devices via a Wi-Fi hotspot."

Please be sure to ask the students which country they are contacting us from and be sure to remind them to take the time difference into account.\n \n2. FAQs\nIn the event that troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, please refer students to the FAQs link that will be in the Remedyforce ticket template resolution. \n \n3. Direct to TEL Officer\nIf troubleshooting has not worked, please refer the student to the FAQs. However, you will need to advise the student to contact their TEL Officer if the answer/ information they need is not covered in the FAQs.

        "content": " Hello,\n\nThank you for contacting us regarding the renewal of SPSS.\n\nI?m afraid that the renewal has still not taken place. This delay is due to the legal department querying some terms within the contract. Until this is completed, we will not be given the licence keys for SPSS for academic year 2021/2022. \n\nAs our team are receiving many requests from users such as yourself requesting access or concerned they will lose access; we have requested temporary licence keys from SPSS to be made available to avoid anyone losing access. \n\nThe temporary key is due to expire on the 1st October, they will then have another 1 month grace period before expiring once again. We hope the full license will be renewed by the 1st November, more information can be provided regarding the process closer to the time.\n\n\nIf you could kindly follow the below steps on how to update the temporary license\n\n*THESE INSTRCUTIONS ARE FOR A KCL DEVICE ONLY, IF YOU ARE USING A PERSONAL DEVICE PLEASE LET US KNOW*\n\n- Please navigate to the Software Centre.\n- Please then go to the 'Installation Status' page.\n- From here, please click on SPSS and at the next screen select 'Uninstall'.\n- Once your existing installation of SPSS has been uninstalled, please navigate to the 'Applications' tab.\n- Please then search for SPSS if it is not immediately visible on the applications tab.\n- Please then install SPSS again and the temporary key should be applied.\n\nPlease note, as the license keys are only temporary, you may still see messages regarding the expiration of the license. These warnings can be ignored as the application should work as intended.\n\nPlease advise if you encounter any issues by replying to this email with screenshots of any error messages. \n\nKind Regards"
